# How the website is setup
---
The body of the website is set up into
* Navigation Bar
* To-Do List
* Poll
* Bee links
* Carousel


* Carousel 

The Carousel was built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript (JS). Three unique images are used along with copies 
of the second and third image. Each image is "floated to the right". The holder element is pushed along this line
to display a single image at a time. A counter in JS is incremented each time the holder moves. When the counter reaches 
last slide or the first slide, the holder transitions seemlessly to the other instance of the image, meaning that the
user can never reach the end of the images series and creating a carousel effect.
